5️⃣ Cleanup
After successfully setting up the remote backend and deploying your infrastructure, you can remove the temporary backend setup files:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf backend-setup/
✅ Summary
Remote State Storage: Your Terraform state is securely stored in the S3 bucket simpletime-terraform-state-bucket.

State Locking: The DynamoDB table simpletime-terraform-locks ensures that state locking is in place to prevent concurrent modifications.

Infrastructure Code: Your main infrastructure code remains in the terraform/ directory, utilizing the remote backend for state management.

If you need assistance with setting up IAM policies for the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table or have any other questions, feel free to ask!

but i will need to go that folder and run command terraform destroy to delete the s3 and dynamodb right?

You're absolutely right — before deleting the backend-setup/ folder, you must run terraform destroy inside it to clean up the remote backend resources (S3 bucket and DynamoDB table), otherwise they will remain in your AWS account.

Here are the correct and clean steps for that:

✅ Steps to Cleanly Destroy Remote Backend Resources
Navigate to the backend setup folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd terraform/backend-setup/
Destroy the backend resources (S3 + DynamoDB):

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform destroy
⚠️ This will delete:

simpletime-terraform-state-bucket (your remote state bucket)

simpletime-terraform-locks (your DynamoDB locking table)

Optional: After successful destroy, remove the folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ..
rm -rf backend-setup/
⚠️ Important Considerations
Do not destroy backend if you’re actively using that remote state (unless you want to fully decommission your infrastructure).

You should only destroy the backend:

If you've already destroyed your main infrastructure (terraform destroy from terraform/)

Or you're resetting the whole setup

Let me know if you'd like an automated destroy script or policy reminders before deletion.
